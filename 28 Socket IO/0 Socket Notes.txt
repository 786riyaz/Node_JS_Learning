Socket.IO is a library that enables real-time, bidirectional communication between the client (browser) and the server (Node.js).
In simpler words:
It allows your website or app to instantly send and receive messages without refreshing the page.

Example in Real Life
Imagine a chat app:
When you send a message, it appears instantly for both users — no page reload.
That’s Socket.IO in action.

Other examples:
Live dashboards (real-time data updates)
Online multiplayer games
Live location sharing
Collaborative tools (like Google Docs)


How it Works (Conceptually)
Normally, web apps use HTTP — which is request → response based.
That means:
The client requests, and the server responds — and that’s it.
Socket.IO, on the other hand, uses WebSockets under the hood:
Once connected, both client and server can keep sending messages anytime — like a phone call instead of letters.


| Feature       | Socket.IO Advantage                  |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| Communication | Real-time, two-way                   |
| Connection    | Persistent (WebSockets + fallback)   |
| Use cases     | Chat, notifications, live dashboards |
| Protocol      | WebSocket (with HTTP fallback)       |
| Works with    | Node.js, React, Angular, mobile apps |


| Concept                   | Description                    |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| `emit()` / `on()`         | Send & receive events          |
| `io.emit()`               | Broadcast to everyone          |
| `socket.emit()`           | Send to one client             |
| `socket.broadcast.emit()` | Send to everyone except sender |
| `rooms`                   | Send messages to groups        |
| `io.use()`                | Authenticate sockets           |


npm install express socket.io
