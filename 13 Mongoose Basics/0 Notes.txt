✅ 1️⃣ What is Mongoose?
Mongoose is an Object Data Modeling (ODM) library for MongoDB and Node.js.
It provides a higher-level abstraction over the native MongoDB driver.
It helps manage relationships between data, provides schema validation, and offers useful helper methods for CRUD operations.

✅ 2️⃣ What is its Use?
Main Uses of Mongoose:
✅ Define Schemas for documents.
✅ Enforce validation rules.
✅ Provide model-based interaction with collections (e.g., User.create(), User.find(), User.updateOne(), etc.).
✅ Support middleware (hooks) such as pre/post save.
✅ Easy data modeling & object mapping in applications.

✅ 3️⃣ What is the mongodb npm module?
It’s the official MongoDB driver for Node.js.
Provides low-level, direct access to MongoDB, including connecting to the database, performing CRUD operations, managing indexes, etc.
No built-in schema or model abstractions.

✅ 4️⃣ Key Differences:
| Feature            | Mongoose                            | MongoDB (Official Driver)             |
| ------------------ | ----------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| Schema Support     | ✅ Provides schemas and models       | ❌ No schema enforcement               |
| Data Validation    | ✅ Built-in validation               | ❌ Manual validation needed            |
| Middleware / Hooks | ✅ Pre/post save hooks               | ❌ Not supported directly              |
| Abstraction Level  | ✅ Higher-level abstraction (Models) | ✅ Low-level (collections & documents) |
| Ease of Use        | ✅ Easier for structured apps        | ❌ More flexible but more code needed  |
| Performance        | Slightly slower due to abstraction  | Faster (minimal abstraction)          |


✅ Summary:
Use Mongoose if:
You want schema-based modeling.
You need built-in validation, hooks, or an ORM-like interface.

Use mongodb (official driver) if:
You need raw control of the database.
You want minimal abstraction with high performance.
