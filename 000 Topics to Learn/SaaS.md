SaaS = **Software as a Service** ✔️💡

It means **software delivered over the internet**, usually through a subscription (monthly or yearly), instead of being installed on your computer.

Think of it as:
➡️ **You use the software online**
➡️ **The company hosts and maintains everything**
➡️ **You just log in and use it**
