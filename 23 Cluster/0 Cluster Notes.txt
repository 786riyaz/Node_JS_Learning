By default the cluster uses Round Robin algorithm in MacOS and Linux

But in Windows, the os load balance decides which core to use.

On Linux/macOS, the cluster module uses a round-robin approach (it distributes connections evenly among workers).

On Windows, Node disables round-robin by default for performance reasons — so the OS decides which worker handles which connection (usually the same one each time).


You can tell Node to enable round-robin manually using:
  // Force round-robin scheduling on Windows
  cluster.schedulingPolicy = cluster.SCHED_RR;
