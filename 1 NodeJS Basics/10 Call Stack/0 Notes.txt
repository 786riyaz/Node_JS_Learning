Node JS Architechture
===================================================
There are 4 Things
1) Code
2) Call Stack
3) Node APIs
4) Callback Queue

Whole the code comes under the "main()" function which resides in Call Stack

Call Stack stores the functions call and remove them once their executions got completed. 

Node APIs stores different API calls and send them to Call back queue for execution.

Callback Query then pass the function execution request to Call Stack once it gets empty.
