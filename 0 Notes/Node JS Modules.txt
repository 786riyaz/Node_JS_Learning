Global Module ::
Global Modules are globally defined. We dont have to define then before using in JS file.
e.g. console.log("")
Here console is global module which we can directly utilies without defining in the same JS file.

While on the other hand, the "fs" module in not a global module. We have to define it before utilizing it.
const fs = require('fs');
fs.writeFileSync("Hello.txt","Hello World");

__dirname
__filename
