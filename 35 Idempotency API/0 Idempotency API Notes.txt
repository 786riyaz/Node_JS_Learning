✅ What is Idempotence in APIs? (Interview Answer)

Idempotence means:
Calling the same API multiple times produces the same result, without changing the server state more than once.

In simple terms:
First API call → performs the action
Next repeated API calls → do not perform the action again
End result always stays same

💡 Real-world examples:
Pressing UPI Payment button twice → should NOT charge twice
Clicking Place Order twice → should NOT create two orders
Clicking Confirm Booking twice → should not create duplicate bookings

🧠 Why Idempotence is Important?
Prevents duplicate payments / orders
Protects against network retry issues
Ensures API safety during retries
Improves system reliability

🎯 Which HTTP Methods Are Idempotent?
Method	    Idempotent?	    Reason
GET	        Yes	            Multiple GETs fetch same resource
PUT	        Yes	            Replaces resource with same data
DELETE	    Yes	            Deleting again does nothing
POST	    ❌ No	       Creates multiple entries

So POST is NOT idempotent by default — but we can make it idempotent.
