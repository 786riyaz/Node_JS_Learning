1. What is an Event in Node.js?
An event is an action or occurrence that can be recognized by your application.

Examples:
A user clicks a button.
A file finishes reading.
A server receives a request.
In Node.js, events are asynchronous signals that something has happened, and you can run some code when that event occurs.



2. What is an EventEmitter in Node.js?
EventEmitter is a class from the events module in Node.js.

It allows you to:
Emit (trigger) events → using .emit()
Listen for (subscribe to) events → using .on() or .addListener()
Basically, it’s like a radio:
emit() = radio station broadcasting a signal.
on() = radio listener tuning in to that signal.



3. Example
// Import events module
const EventEmitter = require('events');

// Create an EventEmitter object
const myEmitter = new EventEmitter();

// Register a listener for 'greet' event
myEmitter.on('greet', (name) => {
  console.log(`Hello, ${name}!`);
});

// Emit the event
myEmitter.emit('greet', 'Riyaz');

Output:
Hello, Riyaz!



4. Key Methods of EventEmitter
.on(eventName, listener) → Listen for an event.
.emit(eventName, [args]) → Trigger an event.
.once(eventName, listener) → Listen for an event only once.
.removeListener(eventName, listener) / .off() → Stop listening.

✅ So in short:
Event → A named signal (like "greet", "data", "error").
EventEmitter → The mechanism in Node.js to create, emit, and listen to those events.
