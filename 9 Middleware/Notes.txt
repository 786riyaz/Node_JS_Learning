Middleware functions are functions that execute before the final request handler, and can modify the request/response or perform additional operations.

Middleware applies on routes. We can modify the request and response. like we can check age of user or country of user etc.

🔹 What is Middleware?
In Express.js, middleware is basically a function that sits between the request and the response.
It has access to:
req → the request object
res → the response object
next → a function that passes control to the next middleware

🔹 Middleware Lifecycle
When a request comes in:
1. It enters the first middleware.
2. If next() is called → goes to the next middleware.
3. If a response is sent (res.send, res.json, etc.) → request ends.
4. If no middleware handles it → Express sends a 404 automatically.

✅ In short:
Middleware = Functions that process requests before they reach the final route handler.
They’re used for logging, authentication, validation, parsing, error handling, etc.
