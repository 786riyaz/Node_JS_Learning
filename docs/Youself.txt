Tell me about yourself ? 
=====================================================================
Sure. I’m Riyaz Khan Pathan, and I live in Danilimda, Ahmedabad.
I’ve completed my Diploma and Bachelor’s degree in Computer Engineering from Government Engineering College, Modasa, with CGPAs of 8.9 and 8.5 respectively.

During my final year, our IoT-based Smart City project won first prize, where I handled all the hardware implementation.

After graduation, I joined Streebo as a Technical Consultant, where I’ve worked for around four years.
I started as an intern working on Angular and Java-based projects like Tata AIA, and later moved into full-stack development using the MERN stack, building applications such as an Asset Management System and a Leave Management System.

Later, I began developing AI-driven chatbot demos for the sales team using IBM Watson Assistant, AWS Lex, and Google DialogFlow, and due to my strong communication and mentoring skills, I was given the opportunity to train new interns.

I then transitioned to the Product Team, where I worked on advanced conversational AI solutions. My key project was the Product Commerce Framework (PCF) — an AI-driven product recommendation system built with the MERN Stack, MySQL, and OpenAI models (GPT-4o).
It used LLM-generated dynamic SQL queries to fetch products and display them in a carousel interface.

I also collaborated on a Cognitive Search System using Vector Databases, Web Crawlers, and Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback (RLHF) to improve information retrieval accuracy.

Overall, I’m passionate about full-stack development, AI integration, and teaching others, and I’m now looking for an opportunity where I can apply these skills to build scalable and intelligent software solutions.
