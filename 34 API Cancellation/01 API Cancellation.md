# ✅ **API Cancellation — Meaning**

API Cancellation means **stopping an API request before it finishes**.

Think of it as:

> "I sent a request, but now I don't need the response — cancel it."

This is done to avoid:

* Wasting server resources
* Wasting network bandwidth
* Preventing outdated data from updating the UI
* Avoiding race-conditions
* Improving performance

# 🟦 **API Cancellation in Frontend**

### 📌 **Meaning**

In frontend (React, Angular, Vue, JS), API cancellation means **stopping an ongoing API request sent from the browser**.

Example situations:

1. User types in a search bar → sends a request → types again → old request becomes useless → **cancel the old request**.
2. Switching between pages → previous page's API should not update the new page's UI.
3. Auto-suggest dropdowns → cancel previous queries.

### 📌 **How It's Done**

Common methods:

### **1. AbortController (Fetch API)**

```js
const controller = new AbortController();

fetch("/api/data", { signal: controller.signal });

// cancel here:
controller.abort();
```

### **2. Axios Cancellation**

```js
const controller = new AbortController();

axios.get("/api/data", { signal: controller.signal });

// cancel the request
controller.abort();
```

### 📌 **Why Important**

* Prevent memory leaks
* Better UX
* Avoid race conditions (old slow API overriding new fast API)

# 🟥 **API Cancellation in Backend**

### 📌 **Meaning**

In backend, API cancellation means **stopping the execution of an API handler because the client has closed or cancelled the request**.

Examples:

* Client refreshed the page
* User clicked "Cancel" on a file upload
* Network disconnected
* Frontend aborted the request

Once cancelled:

* Server should stop heavy processing
* Free threads / workers
* Stop DB queries, loops, or streaming
* Do not continue sending response

### 📌 **Example — Node.js**

```js
app.get("/process", async (req, res) => {
  req.on("close", () => {
    console.log("Client cancelled request");
    // stop heavy operations here
  });

  await doHeavyTask();
  res.send("Done");
});
```

### 📌 **Why Important**

* Saves CPU and memory
* Prevents unnecessary DB load
* Avoids processing for a client that isn't listening anymore
* Improves backend performance under high traffic

# 🟩 **Frontend vs Backend — Simple Difference**

| Area         | Meaning of API Cancellation                                 |
| ------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Frontend** | Stop a request before it finishes (e.g., AbortController)   |
| **Backend**  | Detect client disconnection and stop the ongoing processing |

# 🎯 **Super Short Summary**

**Frontend cancellation:**

> "Don't send/continue this API call; I don't need the response."

**Backend cancellation:**

> "Client has disconnected; stop doing the work."
